# Quantum-computing

 With the development of VLSI technology to such an extent that the distance between the transistors is reaching the inter-molecular level
and at these levels, quantum mechanics comes into action. A transistor that's supposed to be off can be turned on if an electron randomly
 decides to tunnel itself through the depletion region. This might not affect a chip of a billion transistors to a great extent but given the number 
 of transistors, and their size, the no of transistors going rogue may also increase. And this affects the normal functioning of a processor and affects the
 performance of the device.

But what if we use these disadvantages to our advantage? As engineers our task is to get the best out of the worst stuff and why not from this?
 Well here comes quantum computing.

## What is Quantum computing?
 Quantum computing is a sophisticated approach to making parallel calculations, using the physics that govern subatomic particles to replace the more simplistic transistors in today’s computers.

Just like how there's binary 1 and 0 for our current logic quantum computers use something known as a qubit. Qubits are computing units that can be on, off, or any value between, instead of the bits in traditional computers that are either on or off, one or zero. The qubit’s ability to live in the in-between state — called superposition — adds a powerful capability to the computing equation, making quantum computers superior for some kinds of math.

### How does a Qubit work tho?
The two most relevant aspects of quantum physics are the principles of superposition and Entanglement. Taken together, quantum superposition and entanglement create an enormously enhanced computing power. Where a 2-bit register in an ordinary computer can store only one of four binary configurations (00, 01, 10, or 11) at any given time, a 2-qubit register in a quantum computer can store all four numbers simultaneously, because each qubit represents two values. If more qubits are added, the increased capacity is expanded exponentially.
 In the case of traditional bits each of them can hold one value, either 1 or 0.
 ### Working of Quantum Computer
 Using qubits, quantum computers could buzz through calculations that would take classical computers a very long time — if they could even finish them. In 2019, for example, Google claimed to carry out a calculation in about 200 seconds that would take a classical supercomputer around 10,000 years. 

Complex problems that would take hundreds of variables to solve are a huge burden even for a modern-day supercomputers. But this stuff is trivial for quantum computers, but that does'nt mean that they will finish it in a short time. These process may take a long time but much faster than the super-computers.

  Thanks to features like superposition, a quantum computer can use eight qubits to represent every number between 0 and 255, simultaneously. While in traditional computers it would take 2^8 bits of data to represent the same amount of number. There is a decrease in a very huge amount of space and memory.

It’s a feature like parallelism in computing: All possibilities are computed at once rather than sequentially, providing tremendous speedups.

So, while a classical computer steps through long division calculations one at a time to factor a humongous number, a quantum computer can get the answer in a single step. 

That means quantum computers could reshape whole fields, like cryptography, that are based on factoring what are today impossibly large numbers. But there can be disadvantages to it too. Passwords that seems impossible to crack with supercomputers can be cracked easily by the quantum computers.

### Quantum computers in our world
A handful of companies such as Alibaba, Google, Honeywell, IBM, IonQ and Xanadu operate early versions of quantum computers today.
Today they provide tens of qubits. But qubits can be noisy, making them sometimes unreliable. To tackle real-world problems reliably, systems need tens or hundreds of thousands of qubits.
Experts believe it could be a couple decades before we get to a high-fidelity era when quantum computers are truly useful. There is the IBM's 127 qubit quantum computer which is a major breakthrough but as said it would take more than five decades for these stuff to be household products, but then again who knows? same stuff was said for the modern day computers about 60 years ago and yet here we are.
### Disadvantages 
After all these usefull stuff on quantum computing there are some limitations that cannot be neglected

They’re difficult to build. As we saw with IBM’s Quantum System One, a functional quantum computer needs a very specific set of conditions to operate. They require unique components, massive cooling systems, and expensive technology to run at even a basic level. 
 
 Due to the nature of quantum mechanics and qubits, environmental factors can soon produce errors and lose their quantum state (a process known as decoherence). These errors multiply with levels of complexity, which means that to reach their potential, a solution for error correction is needed. 

As we’ll see, quantum computers have the potential to deliver revolutionary solutions in some specific areas. However, due to the nature of how they work, they’re not expected to offer advantages in all areas of computing. 
### Conclusion
  Despite all the disadvantages quantum computing is one of the only few ways forward for humanity to progress. Faster processing and less memory. It is all upto the humans to utilise this properly and ensure that the human civilisation grows towards an utopia
